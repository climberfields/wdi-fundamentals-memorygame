<h2> Instructions

<p> Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs or matching cards.

	<h3> So what's the big deal?</h3>
	<p> Memory games are fun because they allow you to challenge yourself. As humans we are naturally drawn towards challenges and games. Not only can you challenge yourself but you also can challenge your friends! They also help to strengthen your ability to recall short and long term memory.
